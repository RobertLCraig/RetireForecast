/**
 * A property the household owns. The main residence is exempt from CGT (Private
 * Residence Relief) and from means-tested-benefit capital while occupied; selling
 * it is what converts that exempt value into assessable capital.
 *
 * $everLet flags a past letting period that restricts PRR. $runningCosts is the
 * annual maintenance + insurance + council tax used in the buy-vs-rent comparison.
 * $ownershipShare null means wholly owned (100%).
 *
 * $cgtHistory, when set, drives the Capital Gains Tax on selling a home whose Private
 * Residence Relief is only partial (it was let / not the main home for part of ownership);
 * null is the common full-relief case (main home throughout) — no CGT on sale.
