# Decisions: RetireForecast

Append-only log of decisions and their rationale, newest first. Do not rewrite history;
supersede an old entry with a new one that links back to it.

## 2026-06-24 — Persistence: one encrypted payload per row, mappers in the app
**Decision:** Store each Household and Scenario as clear structural columns (name, region,
variant, base tax year, status, owner, timestamps) plus **one `encrypted:array` payload**
holding all the sensitive detail, rather than ~30 encrypted columns. The DTO↔array mapping
lives in the **app** (`app/Finance/Mapping/`), not the engine, so the engine stays
framework- and serialization-agnostic; the readonly DTOs under `packages/finance-engine/src/Dto`
remain the single source of truth and Eloquent maps to/from them.
**Why:** Encrypted columns are unindexable anyway, so a single payload is simpler and keeps
listing/filtering on the clear columns. Keeping the mapper app-side preserves the engine's
isolation. A round-trip test asserts a saved row decrypts to an identical DTO. Follows the
plan's persistence section. [[2026-06-24 — Engine is framework-free, in a path package]]

## 2026-06-24 — Withdrawals on the pension; SimulationRun/Result deferred
**Decision:** Planned pension withdrawals live on the DC pension inside the household payload
(faithful to `DcPension::$withdrawalPlan`), **not** duplicated as a scenario-level field, so
there is one source of truth for them. The `SimulationRun` and `Result` tables are deferred
to the forecast-services step (there are no results to persist until the engine is wired into
the app).
**Why:** The data-model sketch listed withdrawal_decisions on Scenario, but the canonical DTO
already carries them on the pension; honouring the DTO avoids a second, divergent home for the
same data. Deferring run/result storage keeps phase-2 step-1 focused on input persistence.
**Status:** active

## 2026-06-24 — Auth: Fortify headless, web-route guests redirect to login
**Decision:** Install Laravel Fortify but run it **headless** (`config/fortify.php` views
disabled) until the Livewire UI phase builds the login/register screens. GDPR/account routes
sit behind the `auth` middleware; an unauthenticated visitor is **redirected to login** (302),
which is the correct behaviour for a web app (not a 401 API response). A placeholder named
`login` route exists so the redirect target resolves until the real screen ships.
**Why:** The auth backend is needed now (ownership scoping, GDPR), but the screens belong with
the rest of the UI. Anonymous use writes nothing because every write path is auth-gated.
**Status:** active

## 2026-06-24 — Admin: Filament 5 (Livewire 4); assumption-set figures stay sourced
**Decision:** Use Filament 5 for the admin panel at `/admin` (it pulls **Livewire 4**, a bump
from the plan's stated Livewire 3). The AssumptionSet resource curates metadata (name, source
note, default) and a model hook keeps at most one default; the **sourced numeric figures are
seeded from the engine's signed-off `AssumptionSetLibrary` and are not casually editable in
the admin** (numeric editing is a deliberate, flagged follow-up). The tax-year audit page is
read-only over the registry. `User::canAccessPanel()` returns true for this local single-user
app (tighten before any public release).
**Why:** The figures are sourced and signed off; editing one means re-sourcing it with a new
verified-on date, which should be a deliberate act, not a stray form save. Keeps the
"no magic numbers, every figure sourced" posture intact. [[2026-06-24 — Tax figures versioned per tax year, sourced and dated]]

## 2026-06-24 — Mortality model: embed ONS cohort life tables
**Decision:** Drive stochastic joint-life mortality from embedded ONS cohort life tables
(by single year of age and sex), sampling each partner's age of death per path and running
the household to the last survivor.
**Why:** Cohort tables account for future mortality improvements, so lifespans (and the
"will the money last" answer) are realistic. Rob chose this over a parametric fit (compact
but less precise at extreme ages) and over period tables (simpler but understate longevity).
Larger data ingest, but a one-off, and it carries a clear ONS source.

## 2026-06-24 — Forecast mechanics: dual drawdown strategy + cautious default allocation
**Decision:** (1) Ship TWO drawdown strategies and compare them side by side rather than
picking one: "tax-efficient" (cash → GIA → ISA → DC pension last) and "pension-aware" (draw
DC pension income earlier, up to a sensible band, to reduce the post-April-2027 IHT estate).
Default display = tax-efficient. (2) Default invested-pot allocation (DC, ISA, GIA) =
cautious **40% equities / 60% bonds**, no cash within pots; cash accounts use the cash
assumption. Both are runtime-configurable per scenario.
**Why:** The drawdown order trades off income tax now vs sheltered growth and IHT later;
showing both keeps the tool neutral (illustrate consequences, not recommend) and surfaces the
April-2027 tension. A cautious 40/60 suits a retired household relying on the pot for income
(lower sequence-of-returns risk). [[2026-06-24 — Forecast mechanics: ... ]]

## 2026-06-24 — Assumption figures signed off (adopted as proposed)
**Decision:** Rob signed off the researched figures in [docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md](docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md)
as proposed. Set A (FCA real returns + DMS vols) is the engine default; Sets B (DMS
historical) and C (OBR/BoE) ship as compare overlays. Includes the flagged judgement calls:
cash real vol overridden to 2% (inflation modelled separately), Eq–Cash/Bond–Cash
correlations as reasoned estimates, house growth +1% real. Figures stay runtime-overridable
and are re-verified at build time.
**Why:** Unblocks the forecast year-stepper and Monte Carlo with defensible, cited defaults.
**Status:** active

## 2026-06-24 — Default assumptions: FCA expected returns + DMS volatilities
**Decision:** The default AssumptionSet uses FCA-derived expected returns combined with
Barclays Equity Gilt Study / Dimson-Marsh-Staunton (DMS) historical volatilities and
correlations. DMS and OBR/BoE-inflation sets ship as compare overlays. Claude researches and
proposes the actual cited figures; **Rob signs off before any forecast is shown as real.**
**Why:** FCA projection rates are the familiar, defensible default but publish only nominal
growth brackets, not the volatility/correlation a Monte Carlo needs; DMS supplies those from
a coherent historical source. Pairing them gives a defensible default that the stochastic
engine can actually run. [[2026-06-24 — Modelling depth and scope (from approved plan)]]

## 2026-06-24 — Savings + dividends computed in one combined income-tax pass
**Decision:** The plan listed separate `SavingsTax` and `DividendTax` calculators. Instead,
savings and dividend tax are computed inside `IncomeTaxCalculator::compute(TaxableIncome)`,
a single combined pass over the rate bands, rather than as three independent calculators.
`onNonSavingsIncome` is retained for the simple case (and the existing tests).
**Why:** UK income tax stacks the three categories in a fixed order (non-savings, savings,
dividends), and the savings starting-rate band, Personal Savings Allowance and dividend
allowance all consume rate-band space even though charged at 0%. Computing them separately
cannot get the band interactions right; a shared band cursor is the only faithful model.
**Status:** active

## 2026-06-24 — Scaffold the standard doc set
**Decision:** Added PRD.md, DATA-MODEL.md, DECISIONS.md and the root CLAUDE.md orient
tripwire, porting goal / data model / decisions out of docs/PLAN.md so they have a standard
home. docs/PLAN.md remains the exhaustive scope source of truth.
**Why:** The project adopted the documentation standard; the orient hook flagged these as
missing. Keeps a fresh session from re-reading the whole plan to find the shape.
**Status:** active

## 2026-06-24 — Local-first, personal use, no hardcoded client data
**Decision:** Build a local single-user site. Rob enters the couple via the UI himself; any
first-run sample must be obviously fictional. Possible free public release later, so do not
design accounts out — just defer them.
**Why:** The immediate need is Rob's own decision support for a known real couple. Hardcoding
their data would leak PII into the repo and bake in one scenario.
**Status:** active

## 2026-06-24 — Money is hand-rolled integer pence (brick/money dropped)
**Decision:** Use a hand-rolled `Money` value object over integer pence. Do not re-add
brick/money without re-checking the clash.
**Why:** `brick/money` could not resolve against `brick/math` 0.18 in the Laravel 13 lock.
The plan already listed integer pence as the primary option; zero dependencies strengthens
the engine's framework isolation.
**Status:** active

## 2026-06-24 — Engine is framework-free, in a path package
**Decision:** The calculation engine lives in `packages/finance-engine`
(`retireforecast/finance-engine`, path repo, required `"*"`), with zero Laravel
dependencies, no I/O and no clock. Tests run as pure PHPUnit, no Laravel bootstrap.
**Why:** Isolation is what makes the HMRC worked-example tests and the Monte Carlo
golden-master trustworthy. The Laravel app is a shell around the product.
**Status:** active

## 2026-06-24 — Tax figures versioned per tax year, sourced and dated
**Decision:** Every tax figure lives in a per-tax-year config carrying a `source` URL and a
`verified_on` date. Two stale-brief corrections baked in: income-tax threshold freeze runs
to **April 2031** (not 2028); **dividend rates rise in 2026/27** (ordinary 8.75→10.75,
upper 33.75→35.75).
**Why:** No magic numbers; figures must be defensible against gov.uk. 2025/26 and 2026/27
genuinely differ, so they are distinct config years.
**Status:** active

## 2026-06-24 — Modelling depth and scope (from approved plan)
**Decision:** HMRC-accurate deterministic engine PLUS Monte Carlo with stochastic joint-life
mortality. Pensions: DC, DB, State Pension. Housing: buy-cheaper-outright vs rent on
identical seeds. IHT/legacy in as a toggle (incl. pensions entering the estate from Apr
2027). Assumptions are a runtime/display choice across several sourced sets (FCA default),
not baked in. England/Wales/NI first; Scotland income tax + LBTT/LTT out of v1 (region
resolver throws rather than guessing).
**Why:** Matches the decision-support goal: the consequences only become visible if tax,
longevity and sequence risk are all modelled properly. Captured here from docs/PLAN.md.
**Status:** active

## 2026-06-24 — Regulatory posture: guidance only
**Decision:** Education/guidance only, never a personal recommendation. A build-time test
fails if any result template contains banned recommendation phrasing. Signpost Pension Wise
/ MoneyHelper / FCA-regulated advisers.
**Why:** Personal recommendations on pensions/drawdown are FCA-regulated activity. Staying on
the guidance side of the line is a hard design constraint, not a wording afterthought.
