# Economic assumptions — SIGNED OFF 2026-06-24

All return and volatility figures are **REAL (above-inflation), annual**. Three asset
classes: global equities, gilts/bonds, cash. The engine reads whichever `AssumptionSet`
it is handed; a simulation snapshots the set it used so results stay reproducible.

## Why FCA returns but DMS volatilities
The FCA prescribes only central/mean projection rates (the 2% / 5% / 8% nominal lower/
intermediate/higher set, intermediate capped at 5%) and **publishes no volatilities** — yet
a Monte Carlo needs volatility and correlation. So the default set takes FCA-derived
expected returns and borrows volatilities/correlations from the Barclays Equity Gilt Study /
Dimson-Marsh-Staunton (DMS) long-run record. FCA real returns are derived from the FCA's own
asset-class nominal midpoints (equities 6.5%, gilts 2.0%, cash 1.5% nominal) deflated by the
Handbook's 2.0% inflation: `real = (1+nominal)/1.02 − 1` → equities **+4.4%**, bonds **0.0%**,
cash **−0.5%**.

## Proposed sets (the numbers to wire)

| Field | Set A — FCA default (recommended) | Set B — DMS historical | Set C — OBR/BoE inflation-anchored |
|---|---|---|---|
| Equity real return | 4.4% | 5.2% | 4.4% |
| Bond real return | 0.0% | 1.5% | 0.0% |
| Cash real return | −0.5% | 0.5% | −0.5% |
| Equity volatility | 23% | 23% | 23% |
| Bond volatility | 13% | 13% | 13% |
| Cash volatility | 2% | 7.5% | 2% |
| Eq–Bond correlation | 0.30 | 0.46 | 0.30 |
| Eq–Cash correlation | 0.10 | 0.10 | 0.10 |
| Bond–Cash correlation | 0.30 | 0.30 | 0.30 |
| Inflation mean | 2.0% | 3.0% | 2.0% |
| Inflation volatility | 1.5% | 4.0% | 1.0% |
| House growth (real) | 1.0% | 2.5% | 1.0% |
| Rent inflation (real) | 0.5% | 0.5% | 0.0% |
| Salary growth (real) | 1.0% | 1.5% | 1.0% |

## Judgement calls flagged for Rob (these are the bits to sanity-check)
1. **Cash real volatility set to 2%, not DMS's 7.5%.** DMS's 7.5% is mostly historical
   inflation shocks (1900–1980). Since the model shocks inflation separately, using 7.5%
   would double-count inflation risk on cash. Set A/C use 2%; Set B keeps the pure-DMS 7.5%
   to represent the full historical experience. **Confirm you're happy with the 2% override.**
2. **Eq–Cash (0.10) and Bond–Cash (0.30) correlations are reasoned estimates**, not directly
   cited point figures (DMS/Barclays publish the equity–bond correlation, not these).
3. **House price growth +1% real is the cautious end** of a wide range (long-run UK real
   house growth estimates run ~1% to ~3%). Set B uses the historical +2.5%.
4. **Set A equity 4.4% is deliberately below long-run history (5.2%)** because the FCA caps
   the central equity rate — a "don't over-promise" default.

⚠️ Confidence flags from the research: Barclays Equity Gilt Study exact figures come from
adviser summaries of the paywalled study; the FCA 2/5/8 + 2% inflation deduction is
corroborated via the FCA/PwC report and secondary sources; the cash-vol override and the
cash correlations are modelling choices, not cited point values.
